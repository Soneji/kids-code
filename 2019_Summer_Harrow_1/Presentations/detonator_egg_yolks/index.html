<h1><u>Fun racing car quiz</u></h1>
<p>Our car racing quiz game will be lots of fun. Here is how it works.</p>
<ul>
  <li>There will be a quiz in a car racing game.You need to answer the questions to get a step forward.</li>
  <li>There will be an option of which game mode you want.</li>
  <li>Unfortunatley there isnt a two player option so you will verse a bot.</li>
  <li>If you answer the question incorrectly then you bot will move a step ahead of you</li>
</ul>

<p>There are multiple reasons why you should invest in our game. We decided to make Quizzicar due to the success of racing games like Mario Kart.</p>
<p>Our game is similar to this genre of games but it has a unique twist: that you have to answer questions. With your investment we could expand the choices of quiz and maybe make it available to the public to put their own quizzes on it. It could also be used for educational purposes. </p>
<p>This is why we want you to <b>INVEST</b>in our project.</p>
