    <p style="color: thistle"><i>This website will have all the things you need to have/be to say you are a true K-POP fan.Please try not to take this too seriously, this is just my opinion and for fun. This website is still being worked on so try not to judge I am working on improving it.</i></p>
    <p style="color:thistle">Step1: 
    Know some songs! Okay if your a true K-POP fan you must know these 3 songs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boy in love</li>	
        <li>DDU DU DDU DU</li>
        <li>Love Shot</li>
    </ol>
<p style="color: thistle">Step2:
Be part of something! For example I am a blink (a blackpink ultra fan) or you could also be part of the army (bts ultra fan).These are only a few there are many others as well.</p>
<p>Step3:
Have some merch! For example you could have:</p>
<ul>
   <li>BTS Hoodie</li>
   <li>Blackpink Cosmetic Bag</li>
   <li>Twice T-Shirt</li>
   <li>EXO Backpack</li>
</ul>
<p style="color: thistle ">Step4:
Know your members! Blackpink-Rose Lisa Jennie Jisoo. BTS-JungKook V Jimin Suga Jin RM J-Hope Twice- JIHYO Mina MOMO TZUYU Sana Nayeon Dahyun JEONGYEON CHAEYOUNG. so on...</p>
<p style="color: thistle">Step5:
Picking a bias! Once you know your favorite group pick a favorite member. However, if you can't pick because they're all so darn cute then use a quiz. . </p>

</p>
<p style="color: thistle">Step6:
Know your dancing! You should know all the choreography to at least 1 song. For me its 'KILL THIS LOVE' You don't have to know the entire dance just the basics. Another add on thing  you should know a full song in Korean and know what it means.</p>
<p style="color: thistle">Step7:
Never having enough money for anything! If this occurs remember, a person from a K-POP band uses foil for a curtain. Also K-POP merch is a bit pricy because it's so good. Try not to feel put down and end up spending all your money you don't have to have all of them. You can just buy one or two and it can be as small as a rubber. </p>
<p style="color: thistle">Step8:
Know your terms! Here are 13 of them:</p>
<ol>
   <li>Aegyo</li>
   <li>Andwae</li>
   <li>Bias</li>
   <li>Body rolls</li>
