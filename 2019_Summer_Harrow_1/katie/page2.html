		An easy way I make loner names is just use a warrior's prefix. For instance, Ember.
		(As in Emberfoot.) <I>Boom!</I> Just like that, I have a loner name. What about... Puddle! (As in Puddleshine.) 

		Kittypet names, on the other hand, are almost as easy. As with loners you can use a warrior prefix. Or you can use a human name, like Millie. Adjectives also work too, like 'Smoky' or 'Stinky' (Although I seriously advise against calling a cat stinky.)
