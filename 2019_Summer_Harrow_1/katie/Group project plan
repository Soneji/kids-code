Leon - scratch
Malhar - HTML 
Katie - Help with HTML/scratch (if needed), present idea to parents
We are going to make a racing car game on scratch 
(online version, not desktop) In the game, the player will have to answer questions in order to progress along the track. We will each take turns doing a question. There will be an HTML website with information about the game and a link to the scratch project.
