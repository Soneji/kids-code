    Before when Thanos was alive he was a threat to the whole universe(actually half but whatever.)<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thanos">Here is a link if you want to know the origins of him.</a>Anyways he had the power of all the infinity stones once and it definitely had a big impact.But now things will be in peace well at least for the universe as there are many villians out there.</p>
