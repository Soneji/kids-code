	<p>This app is designed to help children with their times tables . We came up with this idea because some children in school have trouble remembering times tables . For example I didn't know all my times tables until I was in year five while everyone new theirs in year 3 . </p>

	<i><p>Now Divit will explain the code to you .</p></i>

	<p>After the user selects the times table the user wants to do the app produces the first question . It repeats this twelve times . </p>
