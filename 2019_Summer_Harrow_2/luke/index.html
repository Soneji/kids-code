	<p><u>Strategy</u></p>
	<hr></hr>
	<p align="left"><t>D.Va is a unique tank with some mobility. With very high health and Boosters, she can close a gap to the enemy with ease. She has high damage output at close-range, making her a strong fighter in a 1-on-1 match. Her Defense Matrix is useful against all incoming projectiles, protecting her teammates from enemy fire. The Micro Missiles deal high amount of damage when used in close range. She is a dangerous ganker in tank class, dealing consistent damage to the enemy. Self-Destruct will wipe all opponents within the blast area. However, she doesn't have an extended barrier to properly protect her team like Reinhardt. She is also slow while firing, allowing the enemy to outrun her to disengage or move around her to distract her aiming. Both Fusion Cannons and Micro Missiles are ineffective at anything further than medium-range, meaning she can be outranged by the enemy before she even has a chance to close a gap with Boosters.</t></p>
	<p><u>Weapons and Abilities</u></p>
	<hr></hr>
	<ul>
		<li><t>Fusion Cannons: D.Va's main weapons on the mech. Her mech can fire consistent shotgun-like bullets onto the targeted point. She can rapidly fire her bullets without needing to reload, but suffers from slow movement while firing.</t></li>
		<ul>
			<li><t>While firing her Fusion Cannons, D.Va's movement speed is reduced by half.</t></li>
			<li><t>Fusion Cannons have 11 bullets per shot and large spreading; position yourself to the closest of the targets so that they won't be able to escape from you while firing.</t></li>
			<li><t>Aiming for the upper-body is recommended due to the nature of spread in combination with infinite ammo.</t></li>
			<li><t>Spraying the bullets at mid- to -long range has little to no effect, but it can pressure the enemy and sometimes interrupt some certain abilities when hit like Mercy's self-healing and Sombra's Stealth.</t></li>
		</ul>
		<li><t>Defense Matrix: D.Va's primary defensive ability. When activated, the targeting-array will pop up from the front of her mech. All incoming projectiles will be shot down mid-air when they come into range of this ability. D.Va cannot attack with her Fusion Cannons while using it.</t></li>
		<ul>
			<li><t>The ability only lasts for 2 seconds when used continuously, and requires 1 second before beginning a recharge. Try to use it as a quick-burst protection instead of as a main blocking tool like barriers.</t></li>
			<li><t>If some hero rushes into a group of enemies, use Defense Matrix to cover your allies when needed. For example, cover Winston when he jumps in or cover Pharah when she is using her ultimate. You can protect your teammate with this way thank to the long range. Keep in mind of its short duration, try not to spend all charge and leaving yourself the main target.</t></li>
			<li><t>It only blocks fire from the front, and cannot prevent incoming projectiles from other directions, making it less viable when used as a barrier to protect her team or herself.</t></li>
			<li><t>Keep playing a mind game toward some hero like Zarya or Mei into thinking that you are run out of Defense Matrix to lure them using their ultimate. D.Va's Defense Matrix is very useful to erase a powerful ultimate if timed properly.</t></li>
			<li><t>When retreating from a group of enemies, activating Defense Matrix while moving backward will greatly help her survive from a strong attack.</t></li>
		</ul>
		<li><t>Boosters: When activated, D.Va's mech will launch into the air. She will move forward with faster movement speed and be able to adjust momentum for 2 seconds. Deals damage and knockback to enemies when collided with. Fusion Cannons are available to use during Boosters.</t></li>
			<ul>
				<li><t>The cooldown triggers after Boosters ends.</t></li>
				<li><t>Despite its little damage, it can still be used with melee combo to guarantee a strong knockback and decent damage dealth.</t></li>
				<li><t>Using Boosters in combination with Fusion Cannons can guarantee a kill on injured enemies who are trying to retreat.</t></li>
				<li><t>D.Va can activate Defense Matrix during the flight to protect herself from enemy fire.</t></li>
				<li><t>Boosters can be stopped mid-use by melee attack or Boosters' key again.</t></li>
			</ul>
			<li><t>Micro Missiles: When activated, D.Va's mech will launch a volley of missiles after a short cast time. The missiles will travel in a straight line and hit the first solid target. The ability can be activated in all actions and can't be stopped until D.Va is stunned or the MEKA is destroyed. The missiles can damage the D.Va who fired them.</t></li>
			<ul>
				<li><t>Combining the ability with primary fire can ensure a kill on an isolated enemy. It is less effective when used on a group of enemies but still provide a strong pressure and enough damage to gain much ultimate charge.</t></li>
				<li><t>Since it can be activated at any time, consider using it when Defense Matrix is activated. This will render the enemy's attack useless and hurt them with a bunch of missiles.</t></li>	
				<li><t>Try not to waste the ability on a hero with a stun attack since stun effect can interrupt the missiles immediately.</t></li>
				<li><t>It's better not to use missiles apart from close range. The missiles travel at a slow speed and only deal small damage upon impact. Additionally, the enemy team can easily see it coming from afar and walk a step back to dodge it.</t></li>
			</ul>
			<li><t>Self-Destruct: (Ultimate): The ultimate of D.Va's mech. D.Va will eject from her mech, which will detonate after 3 seconds. It deals massive damage upon explosion in a very large area around it.</t></li>
			<ul>
				<li><t>The mech will receive any momentum from the Boosters if used prior to activating Self-Destruct. Use this to launch it in the right direction, and even to stall its travel around corners and catch enemies by surprise.</t></li>
				<li><t>The blast creates a strong knockback on the survived opponents, sometimes launching them into a pit or off a cliff.</t></li>
				<li><t>All covers will block the damage from Self-Destruct entirely, even a light post that is large enough to cover the hero size will makes them survive the blast.</t></li>
				<li><t>Succeeding in Self-Destruct explosion will fully charge her Call Mech ability. However, if your mech is blown off cliff while the countdown stills going, you WILL not gain any ultimate charge.</t></li>
				<li><t>After her mech takes critical damage, there is a brief window between the damage being taken and her ejecting from the cockpit where an ultimate can be used to cause the mech to detonate rather than simply being destroyed. This will also give her a full mech charge.</t></li>
			</ul>
			<li><t>Light Gun: D.Va's main weapon after her mech is destroyed. The Light Gun deals considerable damage with fast speed projectile bullets.</t></li>
				<ul>
					<li><t>The weapon is very accurate at most ranges. She can use it to kite enemies and charge her ultimate meter to call a new mech.</t></li>
					<li><t>With her small hitbox, she can dance around and kite the enemy using the weapon's projectile nature to lead the way not letting them escape. Keep in mind about your no-survivalbility in pilot form though.</t></li>
				</ul>
			<li><t>Call Mech: (Ultimate): D.Va can call a new mech after her previous one is destroyed.</t></li>	
				<ul>
					<li><t>The mech will deal some small damage around it upon impact. Sometimes consider using it in combat to deal some damage. However, you must make sure that you can safely return to the mech.</t></li>
					<li><t>The ability creates a strong knockback upon cast. It can launch the enemy to an environmental kill.</t></li>
					<li><t>Both D.Va and her mech can be damaged or killed while she is entering the mech.</t></li>
					<li><t>When not fully operate the mech, any damage being dealt will not transfer to ultimate charge for your enemies.</t></li>
				</ul>
	</ul>
	<p>General Strategies</p>
		<ul>
			<li><t>While D.Va is considered a Tank, a lot of successful D.Va players use her like Reaper. Ganking and harassing are some of D.Va's strong suits. Her high damage output at close range coupled with her Boosters movement ability makes it easy for her to get "shotgun-like" damage in and escape with ease.</t></li>
			<li><t>Defense Matrix is especially strong against most damage dealers. It can even negate a dangerous bullet from McCree's Deadeye or even Pharah's Barrage.</t></li>
			<li><t>You can close the gap on most heroes with Boosters, but you will be susceptible to enemy fire while airborne. Defense Matrix can be used during Boosters, so activate it while flying towards a target that's shooting at you.</t></li>
			<li><t>You need to prioritize protecting the team from flankers and snipers, potentially by rushing them down at close range. Snipers are your first target since they are vulnerable at close range followed by other damage dealers depending on the situation and their position.</t></li>
			<li><t>It is not recommended to play D.Va as the sole tank on your team. Solo-tanking with her is extremely difficult due to her lack of shield and short duration of Defense Matrix. She can't offensively eliminate an entire enemy team by herself like a Damage hero, and she can't provide extended cover like a shield tank such as Reinhardt or Orisa, but she can alternate between the two roles in short, well-timed bursts.</t></li>
			<li><t>Strategize where and when to place a Self-Destructing Mech. The 3 seconds countdown of Self-Destruct is long enough for your enemies to find cover or get behind a friendly Barrier. One effective tool is to use Boosters before Self-Destruct to send the Ultimate out from a blind spot towards a place where there is less cover.</t></li>
			<li><t>D.Va's high damage in her Mech is useful against Tanks. Due to their large size and slow speed, the burst damage of Micro Missiles and Fusion Cannons can chew through a lot of health.</t></li>
			<li><t>Even though Defense Matrix will destroy all projectiles, it will not absorb beams such as Zarya's Particle Cannon, Mei's Endothermic Blaster, Moira's Biotic Grasp, or Symmetra's Photon Projector.</t></li>
			<li><t>D.Va has a large critbox in front of her Mech (the cockpit). You will receive critical damage easier than most heroes, so avoid turning your Mech to face oncoming fire without Defense Matrix active.</t></li>
			<li><t>Ramming an enemy with Boosters deals damage in addition to mild knockback, which may be enough to finish off a low-health opponent.</t></li>
			<ul>
				<li><t>If you melee attack an enemy player while D.Va's Boosters are active, you will deal greatly increased damage and knockback to the target, allowing easy environmental kills.</t></li>
			</ul>
			<li><t>When out of the suit, D.Va's primary goal is to score as many headshots as possible, as fast as possible, to call her next Mech. You may want to target a distant, large enemy such as Roadhog or an enemy D.Va to regain your ultimate charge.</t></li>
