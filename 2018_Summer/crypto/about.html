   <h3>About</h3>

<p>CryptoLock is a company dedicated to stopping hackers steal personal information. To do this we encrypt all text using AES Encryption. This yses a cipher key to enctypt messages and thus makes it harder for hackers to steal. Using Cryptolock makes sure that all messages and personal data is secure. This startup is dedicated to making life more secure for people. It was thought up by us and the code was created in Python. It uses a library called Pycrypto which mkes our encryption very hard to crack.</p>

<p>
DES was developed in the early 1970s at IBM and had been in common use since 1977, when it was approved by NIST for use in the US government. However, by the late '90s it became clear the algorithm was vulnerable to cracking through brute-force, differential cryptanalysis and linear cryptanalysis attacks (although it had been theorised this was the case as early as the year DES was launched). The involvement of the NSA in the development of DES had also aroused suspicions of a back door.

The public demonstrations of DES’s weakness led to NIST initiating a five-year process to select a successor, which would be known as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
Two Belgian cryptographers, Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemen, submitted their Rijndael proposal to NIST – one of 15 different designs to be submitted to the institute. It was eventually selected as the winner, although certain modifications to names of functions and the range of key and block lengths were made that differentiate AES from the original Rijndael standard and effectively make the latter a subset of the former.

In 2002, it was finally approved for use at a US federal level and has been in common use since then.

It is one of the most widely used encryption techniques used today.
