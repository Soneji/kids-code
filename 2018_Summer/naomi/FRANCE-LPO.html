	<h1>FUN THINGS TO DO WHEN YOUR THERE :)</h1>


	<p>Let's say your parents decided to go on holiday , but there final decisision rests on what you can do when your there. You are worring as you have no idea what your family can do to have fun over there...Well this tells you. KEEP READING TO HAVE FUN!!!</p>

	<h4>FRANCE-LPO</h4>

	<p>This one is a little bit different to the others, it is a family christian camp, but i am guessing you are welcome even if you are not christian. Out of all of them this was my favourite it felt like my second home but with way more sun and fun. Over the years I have been going I have made lifelong friends and learnt a lot as well. Also, luckily, there are more attractions outside the camp as well which means you get to see even more. Every sunday(if you wanted), we would go to church and all worship together and praise god. Everyday( to relax your parents a bit) there is a morning group for everychild, but you are split into people more your own age. But your parents donmt just rest they are able to go listen to a service. Even that is not it, there is a lake- which is a long stretched out stream where you and your family can go in a canoe or fish-, there is a vollyball court and a playgroung for kids, not to mention the football field. AWWWW, but the swimming pool(IT IS AMAZING!!!!!!). This is a place to go if you are true to your religion but wants to have a bit of fun and wants to taste the colture of france.  </p>
