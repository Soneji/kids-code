	<h1>Hypernova</h1>
	<h3>What is a Hypernova</h3>
	<p>
	A hypernova (alternatively called a collapsar) is a very energetic supernova thought to result from an extreme core-collapse scenario. In this case a massive star (>30 solar masses) collapses to form a rotating black hole emitting twin energetic jets and surrounded by an accretion disk. 
	</p>
	<h3>Hypernova vs Supernova</h3>
	<p>
	The simplest difference is that hypernovae are stellar explosions tens to hundreds of times more energetic than typical supernovae.
	<br>
	</br>
	The problem with otherwise explaining "the difference" is that at least three different mechanisms have been determined for hypernovae.  One is the formation of high energy jets when the collapsing star is rapidly rotating.  Apparently this will not happen with exploding stars that are originally rotating slowly.
	<br>
	</br>
	Another is a typical supernova explosion in a region containing a significant concentration of material beyond but near to the original star.  Material from the supernova soon collides with this material and energizes it so that additional energy is radiated away.
	<br>
	</br>
	A third is something called pair-instability collapse in which a sudden high rate of production of electron-positron pairs leads to an accelerated collapse and subsequent explosion of the star.  This apparently can only happen with stars of low metallicity characteristic of the earliest stars and then only when the original mass of the star is hundreds of times the mass of the sun.  All of these hypernovae are necessarily at great distances from us, as they can't occur in later generation stars.
	<br>
	</br>
	Hypernovas are ultra-energetic supernovas marking the birth of black holes and associated with the release of intense gamma-ray bursts.
